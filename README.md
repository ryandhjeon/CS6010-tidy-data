## Reflection

In this exercise, Daniel, Ryan, and Justin performed a tutorial for students who want to learn tidy data.

Justin's role was to introduce tidy data and use the example of covid data to perform the `melt`, `pivot`, and `pivot_table` functions.

Ryan's role was to modify and add more into the `melt`, `pivot`, and `pivot_table` functions and assist with autograder.

Daniel's role was to make a bunch of exercises that consisted of autograded answers and questions and arrange the full notebook with autograde cells.

Together, we ran a conclusion about our results and the meaning of all these functions.

For anyone who is attempting to do this assignment, we would highly recommend learning `nbGrader`.

Knowing how to run a notebook tutorial and then actually test your future students on it would be a huge upgrade to improve your coding skills.

When sending a final tutorial on tidy data, it's the responsibility to make sure that future students not only get the right answers, but end up utilizing it for future projects.


## Reflection Questions

#### 1

We did well especially with using the functions: `melt`, `pivot`, and `pivot_table`. 

In addition, it was an experience using `NBgrader` for the first time and we could continue learning.

#### 2

The most challenging part of this assignment by far was using `NBgrader` overall. 

For example, trying to actually grade example answers to assignments successfully on `NBgrader` or even coming up with successful questions.

#### 3

Most of us never used `NBgrader` before so it's quite a challenge once learning to become accustomed to manage assignments, manage students, combine different notebooks, pushing and pulling the necessary files.

#### 4

We would need more help in using `NBgrader`. As for the assignment, the harder challenge would be running the right tests given the examples shown earlier.

Also, we should learn how to send assignments as instructors and have students successfully submit assignments without issues. 

Hopefully, there's a faster way using the notebook rather than the idea of JupyterHub.

#### 5

This assignment was very important in terms of tidy data.

We learned how to modify data in a way that can communicate way easily with the ones who observed it.

For example, with the covid data, there were too many columns.

With the use of `pivot_table`, we succeeded in explaining the number of contracting cases in just one column.
